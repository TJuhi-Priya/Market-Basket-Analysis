# Market Basket Analysis using Streamlit

This project analyzes transaction data from grocery or e-commerce platforms to identify products that are frequently bought together. Using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms, it uncovers frequent itemsets and generates association rules. Visualizations of these patterns help derive actionable business insights, enabling better cross-selling strategies, product bundling, and targeted promotions
